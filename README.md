    This is pretty much our first javascript/html/css project so keep in mind that everything here is a constant work in progress.  Every day we're learning new things that helps with solving one problem or another. Any feedback is greatly appreciated. I was just learning GitHub at the time so I passed my code to Nick to push the commits. -Ashley Mercer & Nickolas Hodder
