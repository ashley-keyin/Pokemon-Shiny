    This is pretty much our first javascript/html/css project so keep in mind that everything here is a constant work in progress. 
Every day we're learning new things that helps with solving one problem or another. Any feedback is greatly appreciated.
While the project is finished for handing in, I (Nick) hope to keep coming back to it now and again to patch it up and add more
functionality. Hope anyone reading this is having a great day! :)
